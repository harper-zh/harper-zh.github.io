                <p>I was responsible for developing the path-planning program, fine-tuning printing parameters, and managing on-site printing operations. This included overseeing color consistency and ensuring the final product's quality.<br />
                    The project successfully produced 15 pieces of urban furniture, each measuring 3.6 meters in length.
